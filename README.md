# gnarwall

GnarWall is a Debian-based system supporting logical firewalls and filtering bridges. We support firewall rules generated by the NDC LFW project of the University of Washington. Our primary goal is to make it as easy as possible to deploy LFW iptables rules and scripts on live systems such as Debian Live. We also aim to support IPSEC VPN tunnels and other advanced features.
