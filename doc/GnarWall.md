# Definition

A GnarWall is any firewall or related system built using the GnarWall project's code and/or tutorials.


## History

GnarWall is a continuation of the [NDC LFW](http://staff.washington.edu/corey/fw/) project led by Corey Satten at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/).  Corey developed CGI scripts to produce firewall rules and configuration files for Linux systems.  The [Gibraltar](http://www.gibraltar.at/) live CD, based on [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), was the primary platform.
